CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

- Cascading refers to the way CSS applies one style on top of another.
- Style Sheets control the look and feel of web documents.

CSS allows you to apply specific styles to specific HTML elements.

The main benefit of CSS is that it allows you to separate style from content
All formatting can (and should) be removed from the HTML document and stored in a separate CSS file
Inline CSS:
In order to use an inline style, add the style attribute to the relevant tag. 
<p style="color:white; background-color:gray;">
    This is an example of inline styling. 
</p>
Embedded/Internal CSS:
Internal styles are defined within the <style> element, inside the head section of an HTML page
<html>
   <head>
      <style>
      p {
         color:white;
         background-color:gray;
      }
      </style>
   </head>
   <body>
      <p>This is my first paragraph. </p>
      <p>This is my second paragraph. </p>
   </body>
</html>
