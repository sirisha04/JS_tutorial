CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

- Cascading refers to the way CSS applies one style on top of another.
- Style Sheets control the look and feel of web documents.

CSS allows you to apply specific styles to specific HTML elements.

The main benefit of CSS is that it allows you to separate style from content
All formatting can (and should) be removed from the HTML document and stored in a separate CSS file
Inline CSS:
In order to use an inline style, add the style attribute to the relevant tag. 
<p style="color:white; background-color:gray;">
    This is an example of inline styling. 
</p>
Embedded/Internal CSS:
Internal styles are defined within the <style> element, inside the head section of an HTML page
<html>
   <head>
      <style>
      p {
         color:white;
         background-color:gray;
      }
      </style>
   </head>
   <body>
      <p>This is my first paragraph. </p>
      <p>This is my second paragraph. </p>
   </body>
</html>

External CSS

With this method, all styling rules are contained in a single text file, which is saved with the .css extension. 

This CSS file is then referenced in the HTML using the <link> tag. The <link> element goes inside the head section
<head>
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="example.css">
</head>
<body>
   <p>This is my first paragraph.</p>
   <p>This is my second paragraph. </p>
   <p>This is my third paragraph. </p>
</body>

A style rule has three parts: selector, property, and value. 
eg: h1 {color:orange;} -- this is a type selector

Selectors::----

To select an element with a specific id, use a hash character, and then follow it with the id of the element
The HTML: 
<div id="intro">
   <p> This paragraph is in the intro section.</p>
</div>
<p> This paragraph is not in the intro section.</p>

The CSS: 
#intro {
   color: white;
   background-color: gray;
}

Class selectors work in a similar way. The major difference is that IDs can only be applied once per page, while classes can be used as many times on a page as needed. 

In the example below, both paragraphs having the class "first" will be affected by the CSS: 

The HTML: 
<div>
   <p class="first">This is a paragraph</p>
   <p> This is the second paragraph. </p>
</div>
<p class="first"> This is not in the intro section</p>
<p> The second paragraph is not in the intro section. </p>

The CSS: 
.first {font-size: 200%;}
To select elements with a specific class, use a period character, followed by the name of the class.

Descendant Selectors

These selectors are used to select elements that are descendants of another element. When selecting levels, you can select as many levels deep as you need to. 

For example, to target only <em> elements in the first paragraph of the "intro" section:

The HTML: 
<div id="intro">
   <p class="first">This is a <em> paragraph.</em></p>
   <p> This is the second paragraph. </p>
</div>
<p class="first"> This is not in the intro section.</p>
<p> The second paragraph is not in the intro section. </p>

The CSS: 
#intro .first em {
   color: pink; 
   background-color:gray;
}

Working with Text:
------------------
font-family has two properties:
font-family : Specific font property like Arial,Times New Roman etc
Generic-family:Serif,Sans-serif,Monospace
p 
 {
    font-family : Arial,"Times New Roman",serif;
}

font-size:
p {
   font-size: 15pz;
}

font-style:
p{
    font-style:italic/oblique/normal;
}

font-weight:
The font-weight controls the boldness or thickness of the text
p{
    font-weight:bold/bolder/lighter/"any value from 100 to 900";
}
